  "description": "condition0 is a versatile utility for polling asynchronous or synchronous conditions in JavaScript. It repeatedly invokes a callback function until the callback returns true or the maximum number of attempts is reached. Whether the function succeeds or fails, condition0 dispatches custom JavaScript events that can be listened to for further actions. This makes it particularly useful for scenarios where you need to monitor a condition that may change over time but have no direct way of knowing when it will be satisfied.",
